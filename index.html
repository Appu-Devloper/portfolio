        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Enthusiastic and results-oriented Application Engineer with 1+ years of experience building cross-platform mobile applications. I have a strong foundation in Dart programming, UI/UX design, and back-end technologies like PHP and JSON. I am passionate about creating high-quality, user-centric applications that meet business objectives and deliver outstanding user experiences.</p>
        <p>In addition to my mobile app development expertise, I have solid experience with Python for automation and web development. I have worked on projects automating server backup tasks using Python scripts to ensure data security and efficiency. My back-end skills include extensive knowledge of SQL and DBMS, allowing me to design, manage, and optimize databases efficiently.</p>
        <p>I also prioritize the use of MVVM architecture in my projects, ensuring code reusability, separation of concerns, and scalability. Following best practices for structuring code, I aim to deliver maintainable and flexible software solutions that align with the project's long-term goals.</p>
        <p>I am always looking to expand my skill set and embrace new technologies, which is why I've gained hands-on experience working with MQTT for IoT projects, enabling real-time device communication and management. I'm highly adaptable, with excellent problem-solving abilities, and a collaborative approach to teamwork.</p>
